        <p>It 'was an <span class="inserted-text">${userSubmission.adjective_1}</span> evening when we decided to go camping in the woods. We packed our gear consisting of a tent, sleeping bags, and enough food to feed an (2) army. As we set up camp, I couldn't stop <span class="inserted-text">${userSubmission.verbpres}</span> with excitement.
        The forest was <span class="inserted-text">${userSubmission.adjective_2}</span>, filled with the sounds of chirping <span class="inserted-text">${userSubmission.pluralnoun}</span> and the rustling of leaves. While <span class="inserted-text">${userSubmission.verbing}</span> the tent poles, I accidentally dropped the <span class="inserted-text">${userSubmission.noun}</span> into a nearby river. Everyone laughed at me, but I felt like an <span class="inserted-text">${userSubmission.adjective_3}</span> adventurer anyway.
        Later that trip, we roasted <span class="inserted-text">${userSubmission.pluralnoun2}</span> over the campfire and told spooky stories. The fire's glow lit up our faces as we <span class="inserted-text">${userSubmission.verbpast}</span> and laughed under the starlit sky. Before heading to bed, we looked around the <span class="inserted-text">${userSubmission.location}</span> and marveled at the beauty of our surroundings.
        This camping trip was one to forever cherishâ€”full of unexpected twists, laughter, and memories we'll always recant.
